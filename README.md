## DSAL Assignments
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Group A

#### Assignment 1
Beginning with an empty binary tree, construct binary tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform following operations on it- 
- Perform inorder, preorder and post order traversal (Implement both recursive and non-recursive methods)
- Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node 
- Find the height of tree
- Copy this tree to another [operator=] 
- Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes. 
- Erase all nodes in a binary tree.

#### Assignment 2
A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display 
whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for implementation.

#### Assignment 3
Create an inordered threaded binary tree and perform inorder and preorder traversals. Analyze time and space complexity of the algorithm.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Group B

#### Assignment 4
Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling 
techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers (use linear probing with replacement and without replacement)

#### Assignment 5
Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions using separate chaining using linked list.
Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert (key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Group C

#### Assignment 6
Represent a given graph using adjacency list to perform DFS and BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the prominent landmarks as nodes 
and perform DFS and BFS on that.

#### Assignment 7
You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to connect 
different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Group D

#### Assignment 8
Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < … <kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access 
probability for each key.

#### Assignment 9
A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole 
data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for 
finding a keyword.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Group E

#### Assignment 10
Implement the Heap sort algorithm implemented in Java demonstrating heap data structure with modularity of programming language.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Group F

#### Assignment 11
Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. 
Display information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. 
Use sequential file to main the data.

#### Assignment 12
Implementation of a direct access file -Insertion and deletion of a record from a direct access file

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## MPL Assignments
<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 1

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 2 
Write an X86/64 ALP to accept a string and to display its length.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 3 
Write an X86/64 ALP to find the largest of given Byte/Word/Dword/64-bit numbers.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 4
Write a switch case driven X86/64 ALP to perform 64-bit hexadecimal arithmetic operations (+,-,*, /) using suitable macros. Define procedure for each operation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 5 
Write an X86/64 ALP to count number of positive and negative numbers from the array.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 6
Write X86/64 ALP to convert 4-digit Hex number into its equivalent BCD number and 5-digit BCD number into its equivalent HEX number. Make your program user friendly to 
accept the choice from user for: (a) HEX to BCD b) BCD to HEX (c) EXIT. 
Display proper strings to prompt the user while accepting the input and displaying the result. (Wherever necessary, use 64-bit registers).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 7
Write X86/64 ALP to detect protected mode and display the values of GDTR, LDTR, IDTR, 
TR and MSW Registers also identify CPU type using CPUID instruction.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 8
Write X86/64 ALP to perform non-overlapped block transfer without string specific instructions. Block containing data can be defined in the data segment.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 9
Write X86/64 ALP to perform overlapped block transfer with string specific instructions Block containing data can be defined in the data segment.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 10 
Write X86/64 ALP to perform multiplication of two 8-bit hexadecimal numbers. Use 
successive addition and add and shift method. (use of 64-bit registers is expected).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 11
Write X86 Assembly Language Program (ALP) to implement following OS commands 
i) COPY, ii) TYPE 
Using file operations. User is supposed to provide command line arguments 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 12
Write X86 ALP to find, a) Number of Blank spaces b) Number of lines c) Occurrence of a particular character. Accept the data from the text file. The text file has
to be accessed during Program_1 execution and write FAR PROCEDURES in Program_2 for the rest of the processing. Use of PUBLIC and EXTERN directives is mandatory.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Assignment 13 
Write x86 ALP to find the factorial of a given integer number on a command line by using recursion. Explicit stack manipulation is expected in the code.
